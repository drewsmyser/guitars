<h3> "Good as gold" is a phrase that gets thrown around a lot, but with the looks and tone of the original on full display, the Gibson Les Paul Deluxe Goldtop should be defined as its own precious metal. The iconic gold-on-maple top is complemented by a lustrous mahogany body and neck for days of sustain to beef up that hot pair of mini humbuckers. A modern classic.
